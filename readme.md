- HW1:

  - Implemented a method to represent sentences as vectors using word frequency and commonality matrices, and found the most similar sentence to a given query using cosine similarity.

- HW2:

  - Implemented a solution to check if binary vectors can be expressed as linear combinations (via XOR) of preceding vectors in the context of a vector space over GF(2).
  - Used an efficient approach to build and update the basis of the vector space.

- HW3:

  - Calculated the transformation matrix using the pseudo-inverse method to recover coordinates, detects noise in the system, and outputs either the transformed coordinates or appropriate error messages.

- HW4:

  - Computed the eigenvalues and determinant of a square, symmetric, invertible matrix using the QR decomposition method.

- HW5:

  - Applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction and representation learning on a term-document matrix, followed by cosine similarity to find the most similar document to each query.

- Project:

  - Q1: Implemented spectral clustering on non-linearly separable data (concentric circles) using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) adjacency matrix Laplacian matrix eigenvalues, and the Fiedler vector for clustering.

  - Q2: Implemented image denoising techniques using both Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), showed how each method effectively removes noise by leveraging low-rank approximations and low-frequency filtering, respectively.
